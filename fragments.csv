# 
# A "symbol" is a 1 character symbol name, followed by an arbitrary list of any 
# combination of integers and other symbols.  Valid symbol names are any keyboard
# character (including special characters like '$' and '?') other than space, comma,
# or the digits 0 thru 9.
#
# A "fragment" consists of a name, and a comma separated list of items.
# Those items can be any combination of either integer ADC values, or strings 
# of previously defined symbols.
#
# Comments can begin with '#' or with '//'
#


# In our hypothetical example, this is going to be a fragment prefix
p = ATTAGCGC

# In our hypothetical example, this is going to be a fragment suffix
s = GATTACA

# This defines example fragment name "alpha"
alpha = pATTGCCCCCAATAATAAAAs

# This defines example fragment name "bravo"
bravo = p, $xyzzy, 123, 192, ATGAA(alpha)ATAGCCCCCCAATTGATAC, 255, 255, s

# This defines example fragment name "ifs"
ifs = 200, 200, 200
