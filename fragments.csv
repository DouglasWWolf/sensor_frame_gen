# 
# A "symbol" is a 1 character symbol name, followed by an arbitrary list of any 
# combination of integers and other symbols.  Valid symbol names are any keyboard
# character (including special characters like '$' and '?') other than space, comma,
# or the digits 0 thru 9.
#
# A "fragment" consists of a name, and a comma separated list of items.
# Those items can be any combination of either integer ADC values, or strings 
# of previously defined symbols.
#
# Comments can begin with '#' or with '//'
#


# Build some basic definitions for A, T, G, and C
A, 101, 102, 103
T, 111, 112, 113
G, 121, 122, 123
C, 131, 132, 133

# In our hypothetical example, this is going to be a fragment prefix
p, ATTAGCGC

# In our hypothetical example, this is going to be a fragment suffix
s, GATTACA

# This defines example fragment name "alpha"
alpha, pATTGCCCCCAATAATAAAAs

# This defines example fragment name "bravo"
bravo, p, 123, 192, ATGAAATAGCCCCCCAATTGATAC, 255, 255, s

# This defines example fragment name "ifs"
ifs, 200, 200, 200
